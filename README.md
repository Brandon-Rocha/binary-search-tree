# binary-search-tree
 * COP 3530: Project 4 â€“ Binary Search Trees
 *  Project 4 class starts by taking in a file named Countries4.csv, parsing out the information and creating a binary search tree using the country's name and calculated GDP per capita. The binary search tree that is created is sorted by name of the country.
 * Once the binary search tree is created, a menu will continually print until the user inputs 9, at which point the program will terminate. 
 * All other numbers between 1 and 8 correspond to different actions to be performed using the binary search tree.
